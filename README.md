The audio files were converted to their respective mel-spectrograms using the Librosa library. These mel-spectrograms will act as input data for the model. <br/> <br/>

<h2>Data Preprocessing :- </h2>
Chop the audio samples and split them into 3 equal parts to increase the sample size. Performed OneHotEncoding on the data.
<br/> <br/> 

<h2>Model Training :- </h2>
Fed the processed data into Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to perform the classification. <br/><br/>
